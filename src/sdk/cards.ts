   * Only use this endpoint if you have provided Moov with a copy of your PCI attestation of compliance.
   *
   * During card linking, the provided data will be verified by submitting a $0 authorization (account verification) request.
   * If `merchantAccountID` is provided, the authorization request will contain that account's statement descriptor and address.
   * Otherwise, the platform account's profile will be used. If no statement descriptor has been set, the authorization will
   * use the account's name instead.
   *
   * It is strongly recommended that callers include the `X-Wait-For` header, set to `payment-method`, if the newly linked
   * card is intended to be used right away. If this header is not included, the caller will need to poll the [List Payment
   * Methods](https://docs.moov.io/api/sources/payment-methods/list/)
   * endpoint to wait for the new payment methods to be available for use.
   *
   * To access this endpoint using an [access token](https://docs.moov.io/api/authentication/access-tokens/)
   * you'll need to specify the `/accounts/{accountID}/cards.write` scope.
