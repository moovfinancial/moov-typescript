# UpdateIssuedCardState

Updates the state of a Moov issued card.
- `active`: Reactivates a frozen card so it can approve authorizations again.
- `frozen`: Temporarily suspends the card so it cannot approve authorizations. A card can be moved between `frozen` and `active` at will until it is `closed`, which is a terminal state.
- `closed`: The card is permanently deactivated and cannot approve authorizations. A card can be closed by request or when it expires.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { UpdateIssuedCardState } from "@moovio/sdk/models/components";

let value: UpdateIssuedCardState = "frozen";
```

## Values

```typescript
"active" | "frozen" | "closed"
```
