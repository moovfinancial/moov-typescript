# IssuedCardState

The `state` represents the operational status of an issued card. A card can only approve incoming authorizations if it is in an active state.

- `active`: The card is operational and approves authorizations. Generally becomes active shortly after card creation.
- `inactive`: The card cannot approve authorizations. This is currently a temporary state assigned post-creation during the activation process.
- `closed`: The card is permanently deactivated and cannot approve authorizations. A card can be closed by request or when it expires.
- `pending-verification`: Awaiting additional authorized user verification before the card can be activated.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { IssuedCardState } from "moov-sdk/models/components";

let value: IssuedCardState = "active";
```

## Values

```typescript
"active" | "inactive" | "pending-verification" | "closed"
```
