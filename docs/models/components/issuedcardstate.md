# IssuedCardState

The `state` represents the operational status of an issued card. A card can only approve incoming authorizations if it is in an active state.

- `active`: The card is operational and can approve authorizations.
- `frozen`: The card is temporarily suspended and cannot approve authorizations. A frozen card can be reactivated by setting its state back to `active`.
- `closed`: The card is permanently deactivated and cannot approve authorizations. A card can be closed by request or when it expires.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { IssuedCardState } from "@moovio/sdk/models/components";

let value: IssuedCardState = "active";
```

## Values

```typescript
"active" | "frozen" | "closed"
```
