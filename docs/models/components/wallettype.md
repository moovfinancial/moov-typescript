# WalletType

Type of a wallet.
  - `default`: The primary system-generated wallet automatically created by Moov when an account is granted the wallet capability. This generates a moov-wallet payment method that is available for use immediately. Only one default wallet exists per account.
  - `general`: A user-defined wallet created via the API to segment funds for specific use cases. Users can create multiple general wallets per account to support internal business models or financial reporting needs.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { WalletType } from "@moovio/sdk/models/components";

let value: WalletType = "default";
```

## Values

```typescript
"default" | "general"
```
