## Summary

Moov API: Moov is a platform that enables developers to integrate all aspects of money movement with ease and speed.
The Moov API makes it simple for platforms to send, receive, and store money. Our API is based upon REST
principles, returns JSON responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes. To learn more about how Moov
works at a high level, read our [concepts](https://docs.moov.io/guides/get-started/glossary/) guide.

## Authentication

### Per-Client Security Schemes

This SDK supports the following security scheme globally:

| Name                      | Type | Scheme     |
| ------------------------- | ---- | ---------- |
| `username`<br/>`password` | http | HTTP Basic |

You can set the security parameters through the `security` optional parameter when initializing the SDK client instance. For example:
```typescript
import { Moov } from "@moovio/sdk";

const moov = new Moov({
  security: {
    username: "",
    password: "",
  },
});

async function run() {
  const result = await moov.accounts.create({
    accountType: "business",
    profile: {
      individual: {
        name: {
          firstName: "Jordan",

<summary>Available methods</summary>

### [accounts](docs/sdks/accounts/README.md)

* [create](docs/sdks/accounts/README.md#create) - You can create **business** or **individual** accounts for your users (i.e., customers, merchants) by passing the required
information to Moov. Requirements differ per account type and requested [capabilities](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/capabilities/requirements/).

If you're requesting the `wallet`, `send-funds`, `collect-funds`, or `card-issuing` capabilities, you'll need to:
  + Send Moov the user [platform terms of service agreement](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/requirements/platform-agreement/) acceptance.
    This can be done upon account creation, or by [patching](https://docs.moov.io/api/moov-accounts/accounts/patch/) the account using the `termsOfService` field.
If you're creating a business account with the business type `llc`, `partnership`, or `privateCorporation`, you'll need to:
  + Provide [business representatives](https://docs.moov.io/api/moov-accounts/representatives/) after creating the account.
  + [Patch](https://docs.moov.io/api/moov-accounts/accounts/patch/) the account to indicate that business representative ownership information is complete.

Visit our documentation to read more about [creating accounts](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/create-accounts/) and [verification requirements](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/requirements/identity-verification/).
Note that the `mode` field (for production or sandbox) is only required when creating a _facilitator_ account. All non-facilitator account requests will ignore the mode field and be set to the calling facilitator's mode.

To access this endpoint using an [access token](https://docs.moov.io/api/authentication/access-tokens/) you'll need 
to specify the `/accounts.write` scope.
* [list](docs/sdks/accounts/README.md#list) - List or search accounts to which the caller is connected.

All supported query parameters are optional. If none are provided the response will include all connected accounts.
Pagination is supported via the `skip` and `count` query parameters. Searching by name and email will overlap and 
return results based on relevance.

To access this endpoint using an [access token](https://docs.moov.io/api/authentication/access-tokens/) you'll need 
to specify the `/accounts.read` scope.
* [get](docs/sdks/accounts/README.md#get) - Retrieves details for the account with the specified ID.

To access this endpoint using an [access token](https://docs.moov.io/api/authentication/access-tokens/) you'll need 
to specify the `/accounts/{accountID}/profile.read` scope.
* [update](docs/sdks/accounts/README.md#update) - When **can** profile data be updated:
  + For unverified accounts, all profile data can be edited.
  + During the verification process, missing or incomplete profile data can be edited.
  + Verified accounts can only add missing profile data.

  When **can't** profile data be updated:
  + Verified accounts cannot change any existing profile data.

If you need to update information in a locked state, please contact Moov support.

* [disable](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#disable) - Discontinue using a specified bank account linked to a Moov account. 

To access this endpoint using an [access token](https://docs.moov.io/api/authentication/access-tokens/) 
you'll need to specify the `/accounts/{accountID}/bank-accounts.write` scope.
* [initiateMicroDeposits](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#initiatemicrodeposits) - Micro-deposits help confirm bank account ownership, helping reduce fraud and the risk of unauthorized activity. 
Use this method to initiate the micro-deposit verification, sending two small credit transfers to the bank account 
you want to confirm.

If you request micro-deposits before 4:15PM ET, they will appear that same day. If you request micro-deposits any 
time after 4:15PM ET, they will appear the next banking day. When the two credits are initiated, Moov simultaneously
initiates a debit to recoup the micro-deposits. 

Micro-deposits initiated for a `sandbox` bank account will always be `$0.00` / `$0.00` and instantly verifiable once initiated.

You can simulate micro-deposit verification in test mode. See our [test mode](https://docs.moov.io/guides/get-started/test-mode/#micro-deposits)
guide for more information.

To access this endpoint using an [access token](https://docs.moov.io/api/authentication/access-tokens/) 
you'll need to specify the `/accounts/{accountID}/bank-accounts.write` scope.
* [completeMicroDeposits](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#completemicrodeposits) - Complete the micro-deposit validation process by passing the amounts of the two transfers within three tries.

To access this endpoint using an [access token](https://docs.moov.io/api/authentication/access-tokens/) 
you'll need to specify the `/accounts/{accountID}/bank-accounts.write` scope.
* [getVerification](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#getverification) - Retrieve the current status and details of an instant verification, including whether the verification method was instant or same-day 
ACH. This helps track the verification process in real-time and provides details in case of exceptions.

The status will indicate the following:

- `new`: Verification initiated, credit pending to the payment network
- `sent-credit`: Credit sent, available for verification
- `failed`: Verification failed, description provided, user needs to add a new bank account
- `expired`: Verification expired after 14 days, initiate another verification
- `max-attempts-exceeded`: Five incorrect code attempts exhausted, initiate another verification

To access this endpoint using an [access token](https://docs.moov.io/api/authentication/access-tokens/) 
you'll need to specify the `/accounts/{accountID}/bank-accounts.read` scope.
* [initiateVerification](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#initiateverification) - Instant micro-deposit verification offers a quick and efficient way to verify bank account ownership. 

Send a $0.01 credit with a unique verification code via RTP or same-day ACH, depending on the receiving bank's capabilities. This
feature provides a faster alternative to traditional methods, allowing verification in a single session.

It is recommended to use the `X-Wait-For: rail-response` header to synchronously receive the outcome of the instant credit in the
  response payload.

Possible verification methods:
  - `instant`: Real-time verification credit sent via RTP
  - `ach`: Verification credit sent via same-day ACH

Possible statuses:
  - `new`: Verification initiated, credit pending
  - `sent-credit`: Credit sent, available for verification in the external bank account
  - `failed`: Verification failed due to credit rejection/return, details in `exceptionDetails`

To access this endpoint using an [access token](https://docs.moov.io/api/authentication/access-tokens/) 
you'll need to specify the `/accounts/{accountID}/bank-accounts.write` scope.
* [completeVerification](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#completeverification) - Finalize the instant micro-deposit verification by submitting the verification code displayed in the user's bank account. 

Upon successful verification, the bank account status will be updated to `verified` and eligible for ACH debit transactions.

The following formats are accepted:
- `MV0000`
- `mv0000`

Only use this endpoint if you have provided Moov with a copy of your PCI attestation of compliance. 

During card linking, the provided data will be verified by submitting a $0 authorization (account verification) request. 
If `merchantAccountID` is provided, the authorization request will contain that account's statement descriptor and address. 
Otherwise, the platform account's profile will be used. If no statement descriptor has been set, the authorization will 
use the account's name instead.

It is strongly recommended that callers include the `X-Wait-For` header, set to `payment-method`, if the newly linked 
card is intended to be used right away. If this header is not included, the caller will need to poll the [List Payment 
Methods](https://docs.moov.io/api/sources/payment-methods/list/)

if you set `skip`= 10, you will see a results set of 200 transfers after the first 10). If you are searching a high volume of transfers, the request will likely 
process very slowly. To achieve faster performance, restrict the data as much as you can by using the `StartDateTime` and `EndDateTime` parameters for a limited 
period of time. You can run multiple requests in smaller time window increments until you've retrieved all the transfers you need.

ACH. This helps track the verification process in real-time and provides details in case of exceptions.

The status will indicate the following:

- `new`: Verification initiated, credit pending to the payment network
- `sent-credit`: Credit sent, available for verification
- `failed`: Verification failed, description provided, user needs to add a new bank account
- `expired`: Verification expired after 14 days, initiate another verification
- `max-attempts-exceeded`: Five incorrect code attempts exhausted, initiate another verification

- [`bankAccountsInitiateMicroDeposits`](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#initiatemicrodeposits) - Micro-deposits help confirm bank account ownership, helping reduce fraud and the risk of unauthorized activity. 
Use this method to initiate the micro-deposit verification, sending two small credit transfers to the bank account 
you want to confirm.

If you request micro-deposits before 4:15PM ET, they will appear that same day. If you request micro-deposits any 
time after 4:15PM ET, they will appear the next banking day. When the two credits are initiated, Moov simultaneously
initiates a debit to recoup the micro-deposits. 

Micro-deposits initiated for a `sandbox` bank account will always be `$0.00` / `$0.00` and instantly verifiable once initiated.

You can simulate micro-deposit verification in test mode. See our [test mode](https://docs.moov.io/guides/get-started/test-mode/#micro-deposits)
guide for more information.

- [`bankAccountsInitiateVerification`](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#initiateverification) - Instant micro-deposit verification offers a quick and efficient way to verify bank account ownership. 

Send a $0.01 credit with a unique verification code via RTP or same-day ACH, depending on the receiving bank's capabilities. This
feature provides a faster alternative to traditional methods, allowing verification in a single session.

It is recommended to use the `X-Wait-For: rail-response` header to synchronously receive the outcome of the instant credit in the
  response payload.

Possible verification methods:
  - `instant`: Real-time verification credit sent via RTP
  - `ach`: Verification credit sent via same-day ACH

Possible statuses:
  - `new`: Verification initiated, credit pending
  - `sent-credit`: Credit sent, available for verification in the external bank account
  - `failed`: Verification failed due to credit rejection/return, details in `exceptionDetails`

Read our [accept card payments guide](https://docs.moov.io/guides/sources/cards/accept-card-payments/#link-a-card) to learn more.

Only use this endpoint if you have provided Moov with a copy of your PCI attestation of compliance. 

During card linking, the provided data will be verified by submitting a $0 authorization (account verification) request. 
If `merchantAccountID` is provided, the authorization request will contain that account's statement descriptor and address. 
Otherwise, the platform account's profile will be used. If no statement descriptor has been set, the authorization will 
use the account's name instead.

It is strongly recommended that callers include the `X-Wait-For` header, set to `payment-method`, if the newly linked 
card is intended to be used right away. If this header is not included, the caller will need to poll the [List Payment 
Methods](https://docs.moov.io/api/sources/payment-methods/list/)
endpoint to wait for the new payment methods to be available for use.

date or 
address will update the information stored on file for the card but will not be verified.

When you run this request, you retrieve 200 transfers at a time. You can advance past a results set of 200 transfers by using the `skip` parameter (for example, 
if you set `skip`= 10, you will see a results set of 200 transfers after the first 10). If you are searching a high volume of transfers, the request will likely 
process very slowly. To achieve faster performance, restrict the data as much as you can by using the `StartDateTime` and `EndDateTime` parameters for a limited 
period of time. You can run multiple requests in smaller time window increments until you've retrieved all the transfers you need.

<!-- Start File uploads [file-upload] -->
## File uploads

Certain SDK methods accept files as part of a multi-part request. It is possible and typically recommended to upload files as a stream rather than reading the entire contents into memory. This avoids excessive memory consumption and potentially crashing with out-of-memory errors when working with very large files. The following example demonstrates how to attach a file stream to a request.

> [!TIP]
>
> Depending on your JavaScript runtime, there are convenient utilities that return a handle to a file without reading the entire contents into memory:
>
> - **Node.js v20+:** Since v20, Node.js comes with a native `openAsBlob` function in [`node:fs`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/fs.html#fsopenasblobpath-options).
> - **Bun:** The native [`Bun.file`](https://bun.sh/docs/api/file-io#reading-files-bun-file) function produces a file handle that can be used for streaming file uploads.
> - **Browsers:** All supported browsers return an instance to a [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) when reading the value from an `<input type="file">` element.
> - **Node.js v18:** A file stream can be created using the `fileFrom` helper from [`fetch-blob/from.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch-blob).

```typescript
import { Moov } from "@moovio/sdk";
import { openAsBlob } from "node:fs";

const moov = new Moov({
  security: {
    username: "",
    password: "",
  },
});

async function run() {
  const result = await moov.disputes.uploadEvidenceFile({
    accountID: "ac81921c-4c1a-4e7a-8a8f-dfc0d0027ac5",
    disputeID: "49c04fa3-f5c3-4ddd-aece-4b5fb6e8a071",
    createEvidenceFileMultiPart: {
      evidenceType: "customer-communication",
      file: await openAsBlob("example.file"),
    },
  });

  // Handle the result
  console.log(result);
}

<!-- Start Retries [retries] -->
## Retries

Some of the endpoints in this SDK support retries.  If you use the SDK without any configuration, it will fall back to the default retry strategy provided by the API.  However, the default retry strategy can be overridden on a per-operation basis, or across the entire SDK.

To change the default retry strategy for a single API call, simply provide a retryConfig object to the call:
```typescript
import { Moov } from "@moovio/sdk";

const moov = new Moov({
  security: {
    username: "",
    password: "",
  },
});

async function run() {
  const result = await moov.accounts.create({
    accountType: "business",
    profile: {
      individual: {
        name: {
          firstName: "Jordan",
          middleName: "Reese",

      retryConnectionErrors: false,
    },
  });

  // Handle the result
  console.log(result);
}

run();

```

If you'd like to override the default retry strategy for all operations that support retries, you can provide a retryConfig at SDK initialization:
```typescript
import { Moov } from "@moovio/sdk";

const moov = new Moov({
  retryConfig: {
    strategy: "backoff",
    backoff: {
      initialInterval: 1,
      maxInterval: 50,
      exponent: 1.1,
      maxElapsedTime: 100,
    },
    retryConnectionErrors: false,
  },
  security: {
    username: "",
    password: "",
  },
});

async function run() {
  const result = await moov.accounts.create({
    accountType: "business",
    profile: {
      individual: {
        name: {
          firstName: "Jordan",
          middleName: "Reese",

<!-- Start Error Handling [errors] -->
## Error Handling

Some methods specify known errors which can be thrown. All the known errors are enumerated in the `models/errors/errors.ts` module. The known errors for a method are documented under the *Errors* tables in SDK docs. For example, the `create` method may throw the following errors:

| Error Type                       | Status Code | Content Type     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| errors.GenericError              | 400, 409    | application/json |
| errors.CreateAccountResponseBody | 422         | application/json |
| errors.APIError                  | 4XX, 5XX    | \*/\*            |

If the method throws an error and it is not captured by the known errors, it will default to throwing a `APIError`.

```typescript
import { Moov } from "@moovio/sdk";
import {
  CreateAccountResponseBody,
  GenericError,
  SDKValidationError,
} from "@moovio/sdk/models/errors";

const moov = new Moov({

Validation errors can also occur when either method arguments or data returned from the server do not match the expected format. The `SDKValidationError` that is thrown as a result will capture the raw value that failed validation in an attribute called `rawValue`. Additionally, a `pretty()` method is available on this error that can be used to log a nicely formatted multi-line string since validation errors can list many issues and the plain error string may be difficult read when debugging.

In some rare cases, the SDK can fail to get a response from the server or even make the request due to unexpected circumstances such as network conditions. These types of errors are captured in the `models/errors/httpclienterrors.ts` module:

| HTTP Client Error                                    | Description                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| RequestAbortedError                                  | HTTP request was aborted by the client               |
| RequestTimeoutError                                  | HTTP request timed out due to an AbortSignal signal  |
| ConnectionError                                      | HTTP client was unable to make a request to a server |
| InvalidRequestError                                  | Any input used to create a request is invalid        |
| UnexpectedClientError                                | Unrecognised or unexpected error                     |

### Override Server URL Per-Client

The default server can be overridden globally by passing a URL to the `serverURL: string` optional parameter when initializing the SDK client instance. For example:
```typescript
import { Moov } from "@moovio/sdk";

const moov = new Moov({
  serverURL: "https://api.moov.io",
  security: {
    username: "",
    password: "",
  },
});

async function run() {
  const result = await moov.accounts.create({
    accountType: "business",
    profile: {

<!-- Start Custom HTTP Client [http-client] -->
## Custom HTTP Client

The TypeScript SDK makes API calls using an `HTTPClient` that wraps the native
[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). This
client is a thin wrapper around `fetch` and provides the ability to attach hooks
around the request lifecycle that can be used to modify the request or handle
errors and response.

The `HTTPClient` constructor takes an optional `fetcher` argument that can be
used to integrate a third-party HTTP client or when writing tests to mock out
the HTTP client and feed in fixtures.

The following example shows how to use the `"beforeRequest"` hook to to add a
custom header and a timeout to requests and how to use the `"requestError"` hook
to log errors:

```typescript
import { Moov } from "@moovio/sdk";
import { HTTPClient } from "@moovio/sdk/lib/http";

const httpClient = new HTTPClient({
  // fetcher takes a function that has the same signature as native `fetch`.
  fetcher: (request) => {
    return fetch(request);
  }
});

httpClient.addHook("beforeRequest", (request) => {
  const nextRequest = new Request(request, {
    signal: request.signal || AbortSignal.timeout(5000)
  });

  nextRequest.headers.set("x-custom-header", "custom value");

  return nextRequest;
});

httpClient.addHook("requestError", (error, request) => {
  console.group("Request Error");
  console.log("Reason:", `${error}`);
  console.log("Endpoint:", `${request.method} ${request.url}`);
  console.groupEnd();
});

const sdk = new Moov({ httpClient });
```

<!-- Start Debugging [debug] -->
## Debugging

You can setup your SDK to emit debug logs for SDK requests and responses.

You can pass a logger that matches `console`'s interface as an SDK option.

> [!WARNING]
> Beware that debug logging will reveal secrets, like API tokens in headers, in log messages printed to a console or files. It's recommended to use this feature only during local development and not in production.

```typescript
import { Moov } from "@moovio/sdk";

const sdk = new Moov({ debugLogger: console });
```

# Development

## Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

## Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically. Any manual changes added to internal files will be overwritten on the next generation. 
We look forward to hearing your feedback. Feel free to open a PR or an issue with a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release.
