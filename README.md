## Summary

Moov API: Moov is a platform that enables developers to integrate all aspects of money movement with ease and speed.
The Moov API makes it simple for platforms to send, receive, and store money. Our API is based upon REST
principles, returns JSON responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes. To learn more about how Moov
works at a high level, read our [concepts](https://docs.moov.io/guides/get-started/glossary/) guide.

## SDK Example Usage

### Example

```typescript
import { Moov } from "@moovio/sdk";

const moov = new Moov();

async function run() {
  const result = await moov.accounts.createAccount({
    basicAuth: {
      username: "",
      password: "",
    },
  }, {
    createAccount: {
      accountType: "business",
      profile: {
        business: {
          legalBusinessName: "Classbooker, LLC",
        },
      },
    },
  });

  console.log(result);
}

run();

```
<!-- End SDK Example Usage [usage] -->

<!-- Start Authentication [security] -->
## Authentication

### Per-Client Security Schemes

This SDK supports the following security scheme globally:

| Name                      | Type | Scheme     |
| ------------------------- | ---- | ---------- |
| `username`<br/>`password` | http | HTTP Basic |

You can set the security parameters through the `security` optional parameter when initializing the SDK client instance. For example:
```typescript
import { Moov } from "@moovio/sdk";

const moov = new Moov({
  security: {
    username: "",
    password: "",
  },
});

async function run() {
  const result = await moov.accounts.getTermsOfServiceToken({});

  // Handle the result
  console.log(result);
}

run();

```

### Per-Operation Security Schemes

Some operations in this SDK require the security scheme to be specified at the request level. For example:
```typescript
import { Moov } from "@moovio/sdk";

const moov = new Moov();

async function run() {
  const result = await moov.accounts.createAccount({
    basicAuth: {
      username: "",
      password: "",
    },
  }, {
    createAccount: {
      accountType: "business",
      profile: {
        business: {
          legalBusinessName: "Classbooker, LLC",
        },
      },
    },
  });

  // Handle the result
  console.log(result);
}

run();

```

### [accounts](docs/sdks/accounts/README.md)

* [createAccount](docs/sdks/accounts/README.md#createaccount) - You can create **business** or **individual** accounts for your users (i.e., customers, merchants) by passing the required
information to Moov. Requirements differ per account type and requested [capabilities](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/capabilities/requirements/).

If you're requesting the `wallet`, `send-funds`, `collect-funds`, or `card-issuing` capabilities, you'll need to:
  + Send Moov the user [platform terms of service agreement](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/requirements/platform-agreement/) acceptance.
    This can be done upon account creation, or by [patching](https://docs.moov.io/api/moov-accounts/accounts/patch/) the account using the `termsOfService` field.
If you're creating a business account with the business type `llc`, `partnership`, or `privateCorporation`, you'll need to:
  + Provide [business representatives](https://docs.moov.io/api/moov-accounts/representatives/) after creating the account.
  + [Patch](https://docs.moov.io/api/moov-accounts/accounts/patch/) the account to indicate that business representative ownership information is complete.

Visit our documentation to read more about [creating accounts](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/create-accounts/) and [verification requirements](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/requirements/identity-verification/).
Note that the `mode` field (for production or sandbox) is only required when creating a _facilitator_ account. All non-facilitator account requests will ignore the mode field and be set to the calling facilitator's mode.
* [listAccounts](docs/sdks/accounts/README.md#listaccounts) - List or search accounts to which the caller is connected.

All supported query parameters are optional. If none are provided the response will include all connected accounts.
Pagination is supported via the `skip` and `count` query parameters.
Searching by name and email will overlap and return results based on relevance.
* [getAccount](docs/sdks/accounts/README.md#getaccount) - Retrieves details for the account with the specified ID.
* [patchAccount](docs/sdks/accounts/README.md#patchaccount) - When **can** profile data be updated:
  + For unverified accounts, all profile data can be edited.
  + During the verification process, missing or incomplete profile data can be edited.
  + Verified accounts can only add missing profile data.

  When **can't** profile data be updated:
  + Verified accounts cannot change any existing profile data.

If you need to update information in a locked state, please contact Moov support.

a [token](https://docs.moov.io/api/authentication/access-tokens/), and provide the changed information.
* [disconnectAccount](docs/sdks/accounts/README.md#disconnectaccount) -   This will sever the connection between you and the account specified and it will no longer be listed as active in the list of accounts. 
  This also means you'll only have read-only access to the account going forward for reporting purposes.

  To use this endpoint from the browser, you'll need to specify the `/accounts/{accountID}/profile.disconnect` scope when generating 
  a [token](https://docs.moov.io/api/authentication/access-tokens/), and provide the changed information.
* [getAccountCountries](docs/sdks/accounts/README.md#getaccountcountries) - Retrieve the specified countries of operation for an account.

to specify the `/accounts/{accountID}/profile.read` scope.
* [getTermsOfServiceToken](docs/sdks/accounts/README.md#gettermsofservicetoken) -   Generates a non-expiring token that can then be used to accept Moov’s terms of service. 

  This token can only be generated via API. Any Moov account requesting the collect funds, send funds, wallet, or card issuing capabilities 
  must accept Moov’s terms of service, then have the generated terms of service token patched to the account. Read more in our [documentation](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/requirements/platform-agreement/).

### [adjustments](docs/sdks/adjustments/README.md)

* [listAdjustments](docs/sdks/adjustments/README.md#listadjustments) - List adjustments associated with a Moov account.

when generating a [token](https://docs.moov.io/api/authentication/access-tokens/).
* [initiateMicroDeposits](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#initiatemicrodeposits) - Micro-deposits help confirm bank account ownership, helping reduce fraud and the risk of unauthorized activity. Use this method to initiate the micro-deposit verification, sending two small credit transfers to the bank account you want to confirm.

If you request micro-deposits before 4:15PM ET, they will appear that same day. If you request micro-deposits any time after 4:15PM ET, they will appear the next banking day. When the two credits are initiated, Moov simultaneously initiates a debit to recoup the micro-deposits. 

`sandbox` - Micro-deposits initiated for a `sandbox` bank account will always be `$0.00` / `$0.00` and instantly verifiable once initiated.

You can simulate micro-deposit verification in test mode. See our [test mode](https://docs.moov.io/guides/get-started/test-mode/#micro-deposits) guide for more information.

* [getBankAccountVerification](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#getbankaccountverification) - Retrieve the current status and details of an instant verification, including whether the verification method was instant or same-day 
ACH. This helps track the verification process in real-time and provides details in case of exceptions.

The status will indicate the following:

- `new`: Verification initiated, credit pending to the payment network
- `sent-credit`: Credit sent, available for verification
- `failed`: Verification failed, description provided, user needs to add a new bank account
- `expired`: Verification expired after 14 days, initiate another verification
- `max-attempts-exceeded`: Five incorrect code attempts exhausted, initiate another verification

To use this endpoint from the browser, you'll need to specify the `/accounts/{accountID}/bank-accounts.read` scope when generating a

Send a $0.01 credit with a unique verification code via RTP or same-day ACH, depending on the receiving bank’s capabilities. This
feature provides a faster alternative to traditional methods, allowing verification in a single session.

It is recommended to use the `X-Wait-For: rail-response` header to synchronously receive the outcome of the instant credit in the
 response payload.

Possible verification methods:
  - `instant`: Real-time verification credit sent via RTP
  - `ach`: Verification credit sent via same-day ACH

Possible statuses:
  - `new`: Verification initiated, credit pending
  - `sent-credit`: Credit sent, available for verification in the external bank account
  - `failed`: Verification failed due to credit rejection/return, details in `exceptionDetails`

[token](https://docs.moov.io/api/authentication/access-tokens/).
* [completeBankAccountVerification](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#completebankaccountverification) - Finalize the instant micro-deposit verification by submitting the verification code displayed in the user’s bank account. 

Upon successful verification, the bank account status will be updated to `verified` and eligible for ACH debit transactions.

The following formats are accepted:
- `MV0000`
- `mv0000`
- `0000`

## Standalone functions

All the methods listed above are available as standalone functions. These
functions are ideal for use in applications running in the browser, serverless
runtimes or other environments where application bundle size is a primary
concern. When using a bundler to build your application, all unused
functionality will be either excluded from the final bundle or tree-shaken away.

To read more about standalone functions, check [FUNCTIONS.md](./FUNCTIONS.md).

<details>

<summary>Available standalone functions</summary>

- [`accountsAssignAccountCountries`](docs/sdks/accounts/README.md#assignaccountcountries) - Assign the countries of operation for an account.

This endpoint will always overwrite the previously assigned values. 

To use this endpoint from the browser, you'll need to specify the `/accounts/{accountID}/profile.write` scope when generating

- [`accountsCreateAccount`](docs/sdks/accounts/README.md#createaccount) - You can create **business** or **individual** accounts for your users (i.e., customers, merchants) by passing the required
information to Moov. Requirements differ per account type and requested [capabilities](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/capabilities/requirements/).

If you're requesting the `wallet`, `send-funds`, `collect-funds`, or `card-issuing` capabilities, you'll need to:
  + Send Moov the user [platform terms of service agreement](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/requirements/platform-agreement/) acceptance.
    This can be done upon account creation, or by [patching](https://docs.moov.io/api/moov-accounts/accounts/patch/) the account using the `termsOfService` field.
If you're creating a business account with the business type `llc`, `partnership`, or `privateCorporation`, you'll need to:
  + Provide [business representatives](https://docs.moov.io/api/moov-accounts/representatives/) after creating the account.
  + [Patch](https://docs.moov.io/api/moov-accounts/accounts/patch/) the account to indicate that business representative ownership information is complete.

- [`bankAccountsInitiateBankAccountVerification`](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#initiatebankaccountverification) - Instant micro-deposit verification offers a quick and efficient way to verify bank account ownership. 

Send a $0.01 credit with a unique verification code via RTP or same-day ACH, depending on the receiving bank’s capabilities. This
feature provides a faster alternative to traditional methods, allowing verification in a single session.

It is recommended to use the `X-Wait-For: rail-response` header to synchronously receive the outcome of the instant credit in the
 response payload.

Possible verification methods:
  - `instant`: Real-time verification credit sent via RTP
  - `ach`: Verification credit sent via same-day ACH

Possible statuses:
  - `new`: Verification initiated, credit pending
  - `sent-credit`: Credit sent, available for verification in the external bank account
  - `failed`: Verification failed due to credit rejection/return, details in `exceptionDetails`

- [`bankAccountsInitiateMicroDeposits`](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#initiatemicrodeposits) - Micro-deposits help confirm bank account ownership, helping reduce fraud and the risk of unauthorized activity. Use this method to initiate the micro-deposit verification, sending two small credit transfers to the bank account you want to confirm.

If you request micro-deposits before 4:15PM ET, they will appear that same day. If you request micro-deposits any time after 4:15PM ET, they will appear the next banking day. When the two credits are initiated, Moov simultaneously initiates a debit to recoup the micro-deposits. 

`sandbox` - Micro-deposits initiated for a `sandbox` bank account will always be `$0.00` / `$0.00` and instantly verifiable once initiated.

You can simulate micro-deposit verification in test mode. See our [test mode](https://docs.moov.io/guides/get-started/test-mode/#micro-deposits) guide for more information.

if you set `skip`= 10, you will see a results set of 200 transfers after the first 2000). If you are searching a high volume of transfers, the request will likely 
process very slowly. To achieve faster performance, restrict the data as much as you can by using the `StartDateTime` and `EndDateTime` parameters for a limited 
period of time. You can run multiple requests in smaller time window increments until you've retrieved all the transfers you need.

<!-- Start File uploads [file-upload] -->
## File uploads

Certain SDK methods accept files as part of a multi-part request. It is possible and typically recommended to upload files as a stream rather than reading the entire contents into memory. This avoids excessive memory consumption and potentially crashing with out-of-memory errors when working with very large files. The following example demonstrates how to attach a file stream to a request.

> [!TIP]
>
> Depending on your JavaScript runtime, there are convenient utilities that return a handle to a file without reading the entire contents into memory:
>
> - **Node.js v20+:** Since v20, Node.js comes with a native `openAsBlob` function in [`node:fs`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/fs.html#fsopenasblobpath-options).
> - **Bun:** The native [`Bun.file`](https://bun.sh/docs/api/file-io#reading-files-bun-file) function produces a file handle that can be used for streaming file uploads.
> - **Browsers:** All supported browsers return an instance to a [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) when reading the value from an `<input type="file">` element.
> - **Node.js v18:** A file stream can be created using the `fileFrom` helper from [`fetch-blob/from.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch-blob).

```typescript
import { Moov } from "@moovio/sdk";
import { openAsBlob } from "node:fs";

const moov = new Moov();

async function run() {
  await moov.disputes.uploadDisputeEvidenceFile({
    basicAuth: {
      username: "",
      password: "",
    },
  }, {
    accountID: "ac81921c-4c1a-4e7a-8a8f-dfc0d0027ac5",
    disputeID: "49c04fa3-f5c3-4ddd-aece-4b5fb6e8a071",
    createEvidenceFileMultiPart: {
      evidenceType: "customer-communication",
      file: await openAsBlob("example.file"),
    },
  });
}

run();

```
<!-- End File uploads [file-upload] -->

<!-- Start Retries [retries] -->
## Retries

Some of the endpoints in this SDK support retries.  If you use the SDK without any configuration, it will fall back to the default retry strategy provided by the API.  However, the default retry strategy can be overridden on a per-operation basis, or across the entire SDK.

To change the default retry strategy for a single API call, simply provide a retryConfig object to the call:
```typescript
import { Moov } from "@moovio/sdk";

const moov = new Moov();

async function run() {
  const result = await moov.accounts.createAccount({
    basicAuth: {
      username: "",
      password: "",
    },
  }, {
    createAccount: {
      accountType: "business",
      profile: {
        business: {
          legalBusinessName: "Classbooker, LLC",
        },
      },
    },
  }, {
    retries: {
      strategy: "backoff",
      backoff: {
        initialInterval: 1,
        maxInterval: 50,
        exponent: 1.1,
        maxElapsedTime: 100,
      },
      retryConnectionErrors: false,
    },
  });

  // Handle the result
  console.log(result);
}

run();

```

If you'd like to override the default retry strategy for all operations that support retries, you can provide a retryConfig at SDK initialization:
```typescript
import { Moov } from "@moovio/sdk";

const moov = new Moov({
  retryConfig: {
    strategy: "backoff",
    backoff: {
      initialInterval: 1,
      maxInterval: 50,
      exponent: 1.1,
      maxElapsedTime: 100,
    },
    retryConnectionErrors: false,
  },
});

async function run() {
  const result = await moov.accounts.createAccount({
    basicAuth: {
      username: "",
      password: "",
    },
  }, {
    createAccount: {
      accountType: "business",
      profile: {
        business: {
          legalBusinessName: "Classbooker, LLC",
        },
      },
    },
  });

  // Handle the result
  console.log(result);
}

run();

```
<!-- End Retries [retries] -->

<!-- Start Error Handling [errors] -->
## Error Handling

Some methods specify known errors which can be thrown. All the known errors are enumerated in the `models/errors/errors.ts` module. The known errors for a method are documented under the *Errors* tables in SDK docs. For example, the `createAccount` method may throw the following errors:

| Error Type                       | Status Code | Content Type     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| errors.GenericError              | 400, 409    | application/json |
| errors.CreateAccountResponseBody | 422         | application/json |
| errors.APIError                  | 4XX, 5XX    | \*/\*            |

If the method throws an error and it is not captured by the known errors, it will default to throwing a `APIError`.

```typescript
import { Moov } from "@moovio/sdk";
import {
  CreateAccountResponseBody,
  GenericError,
  SDKValidationError,
} from "@moovio/sdk/models/errors";

const moov = new Moov();

async function run() {
  let result;
  try {
    result = await moov.accounts.createAccount({
      basicAuth: {
        username: "",
        password: "",
      },
    }, {
      createAccount: {
        accountType: "business",
        profile: {
          business: {
            legalBusinessName: "Classbooker, LLC",
          },
        },
      },
    });

    // Handle the result
    console.log(result);
  } catch (err) {
    switch (true) {
      // The server response does not match the expected SDK schema
      case (err instanceof SDKValidationError): {
        // Pretty-print will provide a human-readable multi-line error message
        console.error(err.pretty());
        // Raw value may also be inspected
        console.error(err.rawValue);
        return;
      }
      case (err instanceof GenericError): {
        // Handle err.data$: GenericErrorData
        console.error(err);
        return;
      }
      case (err instanceof CreateAccountResponseBody): {
        // Handle err.data$: CreateAccountResponseBodyData
        console.error(err);
        return;
      }
      default: {
        // Other errors such as network errors, see HTTPClientErrors for more details
        throw err;
      }
    }
  }
}

run();

```

Validation errors can also occur when either method arguments or data returned from the server do not match the expected format. The `SDKValidationError` that is thrown as a result will capture the raw value that failed validation in an attribute called `rawValue`. Additionally, a `pretty()` method is available on this error that can be used to log a nicely formatted multi-line string since validation errors can list many issues and the plain error string may be difficult read when debugging.

In some rare cases, the SDK can fail to get a response from the server or even make the request due to unexpected circumstances such as network conditions. These types of errors are captured in the `models/errors/httpclienterrors.ts` module:

| HTTP Client Error                                    | Description                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| RequestAbortedError                                  | HTTP request was aborted by the client               |
| RequestTimeoutError                                  | HTTP request timed out due to an AbortSignal signal  |
| ConnectionError                                      | HTTP client was unable to make a request to a server |
| InvalidRequestError                                  | Any input used to create a request is invalid        |
| UnexpectedClientError                                | Unrecognised or unexpected error                     |

The default server can also be overridden globally by passing a URL to the `serverURL: string` optional parameter when initializing the SDK client instance. For example:
```typescript
import { Moov } from "@moovio/sdk";

const moov = new Moov({
  serverURL: "https://api.moov.io",
});

async function run() {
  const result = await moov.accounts.createAccount({
    basicAuth: {
      username: "",
      password: "",
    },
  }, {
    createAccount: {
      accountType: "business",
      profile: {
        business: {
          legalBusinessName: "Classbooker, LLC",
        },
      },
    },
  });

  // Handle the result
  console.log(result);
}

run();

```

<!-- Start Custom HTTP Client [http-client] -->
## Custom HTTP Client

The TypeScript SDK makes API calls using an `HTTPClient` that wraps the native
[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). This
client is a thin wrapper around `fetch` and provides the ability to attach hooks
around the request lifecycle that can be used to modify the request or handle
errors and response.

The `HTTPClient` constructor takes an optional `fetcher` argument that can be
used to integrate a third-party HTTP client or when writing tests to mock out
the HTTP client and feed in fixtures.

The following example shows how to use the `"beforeRequest"` hook to to add a
custom header and a timeout to requests and how to use the `"requestError"` hook
to log errors:

```typescript
import { Moov } from "@moovio/sdk";
import { HTTPClient } from "@moovio/sdk/lib/http";

const httpClient = new HTTPClient({
  // fetcher takes a function that has the same signature as native `fetch`.
  fetcher: (request) => {
    return fetch(request);
  }
});

httpClient.addHook("beforeRequest", (request) => {
  const nextRequest = new Request(request, {
    signal: request.signal || AbortSignal.timeout(5000)
  });

  nextRequest.headers.set("x-custom-header", "custom value");

  return nextRequest;
});

httpClient.addHook("requestError", (error, request) => {
  console.group("Request Error");
  console.log("Reason:", `${error}`);
  console.log("Endpoint:", `${request.method} ${request.url}`);
  console.groupEnd();
});

const sdk = new Moov({ httpClient });
```

<!-- Start Debugging [debug] -->
## Debugging

You can setup your SDK to emit debug logs for SDK requests and responses.

You can pass a logger that matches `console`'s interface as an SDK option.

> [!WARNING]
> Beware that debug logging will reveal secrets, like API tokens in headers, in log messages printed to a console or files. It's recommended to use this feature only during local development and not in production.

```typescript
import { Moov } from "@moovio/sdk";

const sdk = new Moov({ debugLogger: console });
```

# Development

## Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

## Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically. Any manual changes added to internal files will be overwritten on the next generation. 
We look forward to hearing your feedback. Feel free to open a PR or an issue with a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release.
